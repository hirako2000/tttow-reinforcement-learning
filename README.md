**TL;DR**

## ðŸ›  Installation & Set Up

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Install and use the correct version of Node using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## ðŸš€ Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## About

Reinforcement learning in the browser. Without libraries (for now).

Yes of course I could use Python. But does it run on the browser?

Do I know what I'm doing? Not quite.

### Built With

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - of course
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - because scripting is great but it's good to have types
- [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/) - I would have gone with nothing to bundle, but it speed things up to just use a good bundler with Hot Module Reloading during dev.

### Also using

- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) - to check TS isn't too wonky
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - that keeps code well formatted

<hr/>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) of course

### Repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hirako2000/tttow-reinforcement-learning.git
```

Navigate to the repo root's folder then install dependencies

```bash
$ cd ./tttow-reinforcement-learning && npm install
```

### Develop

```bash
$ npm run dev # or npm run start
```

### Build

This command will build everything for production deployment:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

It generates the files for the entire page.

### Deploy

To host the assets, the build placed them all into the `public` folder. this deploy script uploads them 'somewhere':

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

_you may want to tweak that script in package.json, search for deploy._
_There are free hosting services out there, e.g [surge.sh](https://surge.sh), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)._

### Customize

- There is some html and styles.css, but many node elements gets created via JavaScript
- There is typically a trainner file. Game logic is kept in a separate file. And of course the index
- Since training isn't instant, it's always processed via a web worker, to not hold the main thread
- Messages are sent from the worker to get updates (tyically to refresh)

## Roadmap

- [x] Tic Tac Toe game logic
- [x] Human vs Human
- [x] Minmax training
- [x] Human vs AI
- [x] Unbeatable minmax model
- [x] Unbeatable Q-learning
- [x] Render training metadata
- [x] Render AI decision making
- [x] better layout
- [ ] Make q learning actually work!
- [ ] Monte Carlo
- [ ] Genetic algorithm 
- [ ] superb layout
- [ ] amazing layout
- [ ] Measure AI performance
- [ ] more to come I guess

## Acknowledgments

Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto for their great book: **Reinforcement Learning** _An introduction_

If you decide to re-use this repo, go ahead. No need to credit or link back to this repo/site. Although it would be much appreciated.
**Don't re-republish the UI and logic pretty much as is though**, it is lame, and shameless.
Tweak the look and feel, custom the training, make it better, make it your own. Make it so that I wouldn't come across your stuff and think that it is mine. So that nobody comes across your stuff and somehow finds out it's a louzy copy of someone else lacking added value and personalisation.
