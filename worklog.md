### Struggles

- It's been tricky, looked at Q training algorithm, after some struggle to get what I believe was a proper alogitm, training would always lead to a terrible map in term of win rate against human. Still in progress
- Took a stab using minmax function. For some reason, Sutton wrote minmax is inadequate for Tic Tac Toe game... yet it works 

### Change to min max algorithm 

- Afaik also a reinforcement algo, tried this implementaiton to see outcome.
- 100 iterations got me unbeatable map of actions
